# Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI)

## Treatment
| Clinical Category | Presentation | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st episode, mild-mod severity | | <span class="drug">Metronidazole</span> 500 mg PO TID x 10-14 days
| 1st episode, severe | Serum WBC ≥ 15k or creatinine > 1.5x baselien<span class="drug">Vancomycin</span> 125 mg PO QID x 10-14 days |
| 1st episode, severe,complicated | Hypotension, shock ileus, or megacolon | <span class="drug">Vancomycin</span> 500 mg QID PO/NG (PR if ileus) PLUS
<span class="drug">Metronidazole</span> 500 mg IV q8h</span> |
| First recurrence | | Same as for 1st episode (because minimal resistance)
| Second and more recurrences | | <span class="drug">Vancomycin</span> PO in tapered or pulsed regimen.
Avoid <span class="drug">metronidazole</span> overuse because of neurotoxicity. |

## Background

**Definition of *Clostridium difficile* infection (CDI)**

-   Presence of diarrhea (3 unformed stools in ≤24 hours)
-   Stool test positive for *C. difficile* or its toxins, or colonoscopic findings of pseudomembranous colitis

**Epidemiology**
-   Accounts for 20-30% of all antibiotic-associated diarrhea
-   Most common cause of infectious diarrhea in healthcare settings

**Transmission**
-   Fecal-oral route
-   Median time from exposure to C. difficile to diarrhea symptoms = 2-3 days

**Risk factors to develop CDI**
- Age ≥ 65 years
- Duration of hospitalization
- Exposure to antibiotics (almost every Abx has been assoc with CDI – not just <span class="drug">clindamycin</span>)
  - 96% have received abx within 14 days before diarrhea onset 
- Cancer chemotherapy
- HIV
- GI surgery or manipulation of GI tract (i.e. tube feeding)

**Clinical presentation**
-   Diarrhea may have mucous or occult blood

**Recurrence rates**
-   20% (typically within 4 weeks), despite <span class="drug">metronidazole</span> or <span class="drug">vancomycin</span> treatment. ([Kelly et al., NEJM, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18971494))


## Complications

-   Bowel perforation
-   Dehydration
-   Electrolyte imbalance 
-   Hypoalbuminemia
-   Hypotension
-   Renal failure
-   SIRS, sepsis, death
-   Toxic megacolon
